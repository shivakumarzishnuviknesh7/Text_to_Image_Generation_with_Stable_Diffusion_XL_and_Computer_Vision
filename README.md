This project leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to convert textual descriptions into images using the Stable Diffusion XL model from Hugging Face. By integrating the state-of-the-art stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 model with a user-friendly front end built on Streamlit, this application provides an interactive platform for users to visualize their ideas and concepts in image form.
